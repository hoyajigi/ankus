What is Ankus?  

November 29, 2013  
We released ankus 0.1 (branch : new_ankus-0.1)  

New features of ankus 0.1  
1) Classification - ID3  
2) Clustering - EM  
3) Similarity - Content based Similarity  
4) Recommendation System - Item based recommendation  
5) Recommendation verify module(use RMSE)  



Ankus is an open source data mining / machine learning based MapReduce that supports a variety of advanced algorithms. Apache Mahout have the same goal with us, Mahout complicated convert to Sequence files and configure parameters for a wide variety of machine learning algorithms. But as Ankus can see below, Almost do not need to generate input dataset POV(Point of view) analysis as set up a variety of custom parameters Focus on the pre-processing as normalization dataset

OUR GOAL IS, Machine learning and data mining library on top of Apache Hadoop using the map/reduce paradigm. And they are an open source project.

Supoort algorithms.

Basic statistics computation for numeric/nominal data (3 methods)
Pre-processing (Normalization, 1 method)
Similarity/correlation analysis for vector type data (3 methods)
Classification/clustering analysis (3 methods)
CF based recommendation analysis (4 methods)
Feauture

Can use without input-file conversion
Support various parameters for algorithms
Support basic statistics and pre-processing methods
Support attributes selection for analysis
Currently, we release Ankus 0.0.1 version on 12, September, 2013
