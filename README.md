What is Ankus

Ankus is an open source data mining / machine learning  based MapReduce that supports a variety of advanced algorithms. Apache Mahout have the same goal with us, Mahout complicated convert to Sequence files and configure parameters for a wide variety of machine learning algorithms.
But as Ankus can see below,
Almost do not need to generate input dataset
POV(Point of view) analysis as set up a variety of custom parameters
Focus on the pre-processing as normalization dataset

OUR GOAL IS,
Machine learning and data mining library on top of Apache Hadoop using the map/reduce paradigm. And they are an open source project.

Supoort algorithms.
- Basic statistics computation for numeric/nominal data (3 methods)
- Pre-processing (Normalization, 1 method)
- Similarity/correlation analysis for vector type data (3 methods)
- Classification/clustering analysis (3 methods)
- CF based recommendation analysis (4 methods)

Feauture
- Can use without input-file conversion
- Support various parameters for algorithms
- Support basic statistics and pre-processing methods
- Support attributes selection for analysis


Currently, we release Ankus 0.0.1 version on 12, September, 2013
