What is Ankus?  

November 29, 2013  
We released ankus 0.1 (branch : new_ankus-0.1)  

New features of ankus 0.1  
1) Classification - ID3  
2) Clustering - EM  
3) Similarity - Content based Similarity  
4) Recommendation System - Item based recommendation  
5) Recommendation verify module(use RMSE)  



Ankus is an open source data mining / machine learning based MapReduce that supports a variety of advanced algorithms. Apache Mahout have the same goal with us, Mahout complicated convert to Sequence files and configure parameters for a wide variety of machine learning algorithms. But as Ankus can see below, Almost do not need to generate input dataset POV(Point of view) analysis as set up a variety of custom parameters Focus on the pre-processing as normalization dataset

OUR GOAL is, machine learning and data mining library on top of Apache Hadoop using the map/reduce paradigm. And they are an open source project.

Supoort algorithms.

1) Basic statistics computation for numeric/nominal data (3 methods)  
2) Pre-processing (Normalization, 1 method)  
3) Similarity/correlation analysis for vector type data (3 methods)  
4) Classification/clustering analysis (3 methods)  
5) CF based recommendation analysis (4 methods)  

Feautures

1) Can use without input-file conversion  
2) Support various parameters for algorithms  
3) Support basic statistics and pre-processing methods  
4) Support attributes selection for analysis

Currently, we release Ankus 0.1 version on November, 2013
